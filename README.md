# Blackjack game Web Application

> This project creates a game of Blackjacj that can be run on the browser, it was created using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

The project has three modules to create three types of objects. First players, second cards, and the third is the deck of cards for the game. The deck of cards consists of 52 cards with 13 values and four suits.
In the src folder, there are the methods that create the functionalities of the program. The Home page has two buttons that allow creating a new player or if the user is already registered give the option to play.
Note: `A player needs to be registered first to be able to play .`


The player can win the game if they get a score equal to 21. The game cards are generated automatically and randomly (validating that the new card draw doesn't already exist in the game). For each time that a player wins they earn 1,000USD, also the cards have prizes of 100 for the numbers and 500 for the letters. The price is accumulative in the same session, but when the game finishes (because the player loses or decides to finish), the prize restart to 0. If the player wins or loses the button to draw a new card will be disabled and if the player presses the new game button a new game will start no matter the state of the current game.
